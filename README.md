# Project 0: Tick Tac Toe

This is a simple game

## features

it has lasers

## bugs

## TODO

## technologies.
- Made with jquery
- also uses funtext to make


## Thank you
-  

the most important thing your readme file should include! a link to the live demo of your project (the github.io version)


## Challenges and Fixes
- Try again button. instead of repeating (DRY!!) just changed the original html and made it visible and tryAgainVisible by changing it at the CSS level. Allowed to remove extra css rule just for it.


## Game engagement points
- Try to keep them playing again.  
- Massive Play again button
- Curious about what each animation does at static, win and lose
- curious about Easter egg.
- "undo" -  special feature. gets the game exciting at another level
- Scoring - keeping account of wins - get more points.


## lessons learnt.
- Even something as simple as tic tac toe, which is easy asf IRL can require some thinking when replicating it virtually!
- debugging using alert on each line or debugger;
- "Google is your best friend!" - Rashida Bangali 2019.
- if you need to repeat yourself - use loops!
- best to have the basics done and have a skeleton before going after the big features.
